Introduction:

Sentiment analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding public opinion, and this project aims to apply machine learning techniques to analyze sentiments related to the New BRICS nations. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models, we aim to provide insights into public sentiments expressed in text data.

Features:

Sentiment analysis on text data related to the New BRICS nations.
NLP techniques for text preprocessing.
Machine learning models for sentiment classification.
Sentiment Classification: The core functionality of this project is the sentiment classification system. It classifies input text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Prerequisites:
install the necesary libraies such as:
1.Numpy
2.Pandas
3.Sklearn
4.XGBoost
